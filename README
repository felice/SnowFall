An iPhone sdk class to simulate a snow fall
-------------------------------------------

SnowFallView is a UIView subclass. Its job is to simulate a snow fall in transparency over another view. It uses CAAnimation to perform 2 animations: a vertical (transition.y) and a rotational (rotate.y) transforms.

These parameters can be customized:

the view size and origin
the flake image
the flakes range of size (min-max)
the flakes count
the animations speed range (min-max) and repeat count.

Source code can be modified and adapted to any liking. An example app is shown with the code.
